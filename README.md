## Inspiration

There are many great educational resources and solutions for software development, however, there currently is no well-known method to learning how to develop an application. We seek to provide an easy to use and straight forward medium that guides a user through a series of tutorials focusing on the application development process!

## What it does

JSOrchestra is a Google Chrome extension for jsfiddle.net which creates app development tutorials using the jsfiddle editor and compiler. Markup and JavaScript are inputted from the user with the guidance of our JSOrchestra tutorial box, which enables the user to compile and run through the custom jsfiddle editor. 

## How we built it

Reactjs and determination
